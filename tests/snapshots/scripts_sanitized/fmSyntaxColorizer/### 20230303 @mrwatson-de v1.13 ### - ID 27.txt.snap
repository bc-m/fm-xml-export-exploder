				- [improvement] Changed the color highlighting to ScriptResult rather than ScriptParam
# 20220317 MrW v1.8 Improvements to Syntax-Colorizing:
				- [feature] Added *ScriptParam* syntax to help distinguish ScriptParameters from ScriptResults! (I've just used ScriptParameter once too often where I should be using ScriptResult!)

# 20211209 MrW v1.7 Added MBS Variable autocomplete

				- [feature] Added MBS Blue color for MBS Script Step
				- [enhancement] Reduced the number of syntax definitions by deleting unnecessary entries
				- [enhancement] Also moved functions out of the Core to a new category, since they are all undefined in the default color palette anyhow
